# WebGL Tessellation
This is an assignment for Computer Graphics and Fundamentals course.<br>

* Showing two triangles, one simple and the other tessellated, both in line/wireframe drawing style
* Showing two tessellated and twisted triangles, both in filled-color form
* Show four other polygons, starting from a square up to an octagon (skipping heptagon: square, pentagon, hexagon, octagon), in line form
* Show the same as in the previous item, but as tessellated polygons (in line/wireframe drawing style), each polygon being split into a smaller set of triangles (using 5 recursive subdivisions)
* Show the same as the item above, but as filled and twisted polygons, starting from a triangle on the left to an octagon (skipping heptagon: triangle, square, pentagon, hexagon, octagon), in filled-color form
